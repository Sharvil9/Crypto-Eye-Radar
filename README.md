## üìö Developer Guide

- **Project Structure:**  
  ```
  src/
    components/      # Reusable UI components
    pages/           # Main page components (Dashboard, WalletDetail, CoinDetail)
    services/        # API interaction and business logic
    utils/           # Helper utilities, API mocks, etc.
    types/           # TypeScript type definitions
  ```

- **Adding a New Feature:**  
  1. Create a new component in `src/components/`
  2. Add necessary logic in `src/services/` or `src/utils/`
  3. Update routing in `src/App.tsx` if it's a new page

- **API Integration:**  
    - All external API calls are centralized in `src/services/` and `src/utils/cryptoApi.ts`.
    - Use provided mock functions for local development; replace with live API endpoints for production.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

> **"Security isn‚Äôt a feature, it‚Äôs the foundation. Your data, your coins &mdash; always protected."**

- **Best Practices for Users:**
  - Always use strong, unique passwords for your wallets and exchanges.
  - Never share private keys or recovery phrases with anyone, ever.
  - Use hardware wallets for large holdings.
  - Keep your browser and OS updated.
  - Run CryptoEye Radar locally; never enter sensitive info on untrusted deployments.

- **Vulnerability Reporting:**  
  If you discover a security issue, **please report it responsibly** by raising a Issue.

- **Security Audits:**  
  _As of now, CryptoEye Radar has not undergone a third-party security audit. All code is open-source for transparency. Community reviews and PRs focusing on security are highly encouraged._

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

CryptoEye Radar follows a modular, component-driven architecture:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UI(User Interface) --> State(State Management)
    State --> API(API Services)
    API --> Logic(Portfolio Logic & Analytics)
    Logic --> Viz(Visualization)
    UI --> Notify(Notifications & Alerts)
    State --> Router(Routing)
```

**Design Decisions & Trade-offs:**
- **Mock API Layer:** Fast development and easy demoing; can swap for real APIs with minimal changes.
- **Component Reuse:** UI split into atomic components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Security:** No sensitive data leaves the client by design, but ultimate security depends on user practices and deployment environment.

---

## ‚ö° Performance

- **Benchmarks:**  
  - Loads dashboard & wallet data in <1s with mock APIs.
  - UI interactions remain responsive for up to 100 wallets.

- **Optimization Tips:**  
  - Use production builds (`npm run build`) for fastest performance.
  - Avoid running on resource-constrained devices for large portfolios.
  - Cache API responses for non-sensitive, public data if integrating with real APIs.
